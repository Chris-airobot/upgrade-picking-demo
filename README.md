# New method for the demo
 - [GGCNN](https://github.com/dougsm/mvp_grasp) for generating grasps
 - [Manipulability Motion Control](https://jhavl.github.io/mmc/) for moving 


# Updates
## For GGCNN grasping
- The code can run through now, first launch the ggcnn_service launch file, then run the 'test.ipynb' to see the result
- But the output pose is really off, still needs to be debugged

## For robot model
- Velocity control has been implemented, basically ditch the MoveIt! package for now
